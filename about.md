# About Me
I'm Jerry Orr, a full-stack software developer specializing in JVM-based web applications.
I hail from Pennsylvania, USA, and I've been slinging code longer than I care to admit.

This site is primarily my place to dump whatever thoughts I have that I care to remember later,
mostly regarding programming and technology.

My primary social media home right now is on Mastodon at

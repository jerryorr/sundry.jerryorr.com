_Note: my problem involved the **Harbor Breeze Crosswinds 52 in. Ceiling Fan (Model #40092)**,

I recently purchased and installed a _Harbor Breeze Crosswinds 52 in. Ceiling Fan (Model #40092)_.
When I finally finished the installation and flipped on the switch, the fan made a clicking sound,
and not much happened. Depending on what I had switched on, the fan might slowly spin for a moment
before stopping, and the light might dimly fade on with a buzzing sound.

I found [lots of similar complaints](http://harborbreezeshop.com/harbor-breeze-ceiling-fans-light-problems/),
but no solutions seemed to match my situation. Fortunately, my brother suggested that the problem
might be the 3-way fan control switch that controlled the old fan. My understanding is that each
position on the 3-way toggle sends a slightly different voltage to the fan, indicating what speed
it should be. However, since the *Harbor Breeze Crosswinds* is controlled by remote, it can't handle
the varying voltages, and simply didn't work correctly.


Sure enough, **I replaced the 3-way control with a standard
